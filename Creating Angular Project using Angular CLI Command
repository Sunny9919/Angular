I am going to create the Angular Project in my D directory. So, change the directory location to D in the command prompt by typing D:
In order to create a project using Angular CLI, you need to use the ng new project-name command. I am going to give the project name as MyFirstAngularApp. So type the command as ng new MyFirstAngularApp
In order to compile the project, you need to use the ng serve command
Instead of using the ng serve command, you can also use the ng serve -o command which will run the project automatically using your default browser.
